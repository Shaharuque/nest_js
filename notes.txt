## For data validation and transformation we can use Pipes
custom pipe can be made by using the following command
nest g pipe common/pipes/validation.pipe

## importance of Pipe: it maintains single responsibilty principle
Why use single responsibility?
By having a single responsibility for each component, you can isolate the impact of changes and reduce the risk of breaking other parts of the system. You can also follow the open-closed principle, which states that your components should be open for extension but closed for modification
